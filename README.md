## Get Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Docker installed
- Visual Studio Code installed
- Recommended VS Code extensions installed (check the "Extensions: show recommended extensions" command)

### Usage

To deploy the infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Generate HCP Terraform account token: You can do this by navigating to [Settings > Tokens](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens).
2. Create an HCP Terraform Organization and update the `TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` variable in `.devcontainer/.env` with your HCP Terraform Organization name.
3. Start the devcontainer: Open the devcontainer via VSCode, GitHub Codespaces, or other supported environments and select the Terraform container.
4. (Optional) Update the Lambda function: Modify the `src/lambda.py` file, then run the following scripts:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/aws/lambda/00-install-package.sh
    ./scripts/aws/lambda/01-compress-package.sh
    ```

5. Deploy the infrastructure: Run the script to deploy:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/terraform/00-terraform.sh
   ```

6. (Optional) [Testing Lambda locally](#testing-lambda-locally)

### Clean Up Resources

After finishing, you can clean up AWS resources via the Terraform CLI or HCP Terraform Workspace page.

```Shell
terraform plan -destroy -out=destroy.tfplan
terraform apply destroy.tfplan
```

### Folder Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure to organize the code and resources.
Here is an overview of the folder structure: [Read here](docs/folder-structure.md)

Feel free to explore each folder to understand the purpose and contents of each.

## Workflows

## Testing Lambda Locally

To test Lambda functions locally, we utilize AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model).
Detailed steps for setting up and running tests can be found in the documentation: [SAM](docs/sam.md)

## Summary

In this project, you learned:

- How to use Terraform (IaC) and manage it in the cloud with HCP Terraform.
- Explored various AWS services to implement a workflow where uploaded images in S3 trigger a Lambda function to generate thumbnails and update metadata in DynamoDB.
- Set up a development environment using devcontainers for fast and easy project setup.
- Utilized AWS SAM for seamless local testing of Lambda functions.
- Managed repository and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub.
- Created architectural diagrams using diagram-as-code tools.
- Provided detailed documentation of Terraform modules in [`docs/terraform.md`](terraform.md).
- Ensured code quality through pre-commit hooks with tools like Ruff, Gitlint, Gitleaks, Trivy, and more.
